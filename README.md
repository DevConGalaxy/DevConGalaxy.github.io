  data.json
  solution.html
  images\
```

`cover.png` is the image that will be diaplayed as a header on the homepage of the platform.

`solution.html` The correction of the workshop can be put in this file. It is accessible when typing the konami code in a tutorial

Put all the images you need in the workshop in the `image` folder

#### data.json

```json
{
    "resources": [
        {
            "label": "jupyter project Zip file",
            "type": "fas fa-download",
            "link": "./assets/codelabs/prog-quantique/algo.zip"
        },
        {

            "type": "fab fa-youtube",
            "link": "https://youtu.be/uQhyl_7dmzE"
        }        
    ]
}
```

#### tutorial.md

```markdhwo
---
